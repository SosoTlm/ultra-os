Hello dear developer, you're probably
here to have access to the operating
system files, right?

This part of the operating system
must be taken seriously as its all
.asm files and bunch of stuff & icons.

You are responsible for any damage
caused to your system when remaking
an operating system based-off those files.
___________________________
NOTICE:
Remake EVERY SINGLE icons of the operating
system as we don't you to make money, have success
nor sell the icons and saying it's yours!

We will be straight to the point.
COPYRIGHT STRIKE will occur if not respecting this!
